Brief Bio:

	My name is Daniel Grabinski.  I was born February 23, 1987 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
I lived in a city called Nanticoke for most of my life and is where I went to high school.  My curriculum 
there was academic, focusing on math because the school didn't offer programming classes.  I played four sports
my senior year and averaged a 4.0 in all fields of study.  After graduating in 2005, I was accepted at 
Drexel University in Philadelphia.  I moved down there for 2 years, and had taken Software Engineering 
as my major.  Unfortunately, Drexel came at a price and I didn't come from a wealthy background.  I had to make 
the decision to leave to lessen loan damage.  I left during my pre-junior year to come back home, save money, 
and acquire an obtainable degree.
	I found a job and used the earnings to go to the local community college (Luzerne County Community 
College).  I majored in Computer Information Systems and received my Associate's degree in a year.  After 
graduating, I started saving money again.  I moved to Los Angeles in November, 2010.  I was hoping to get my 
foot in the door as anything in the video game business.
	Which brings us to the present.  I am currently still currently in Los Angeles, but i will be 
departing home yet again on May 30th, six months after arrival.  It was a great experience, but unfortunately,
my career isn't here right now and the savings are running dry.  It's time to salvage what I can and retry
again.
